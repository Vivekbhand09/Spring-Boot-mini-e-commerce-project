# üõí Spring Boot Mini E-Commerce Project

This is my **first Spring Boot project**, a simple **Mini E-Commerce Application** where users can:
- Add products
- Update product details
- Delete products
- Add products to a cart
- Remove products from a cart

I created this project while taking my first steps into **Java Spring Boot** after completing my **Full Stack MERN development journey**. This project helped me understand the fundamentals of Spring Boot, backend development in Java, and integration with in-memory databases.

## üõ† Dependencies Used

### 1. **Spring Web**
- Enables building web applications using Spring MVC
- Provides REST API endpoints for the project

### 2. **Lombok**
- Reduces boilerplate code with annotations like:
  - `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@Data`
  - `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`
- Makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain

### 3. **H2 Database**
- In-memory relational database
- Perfect for testing and development without external DB setup
- Can be accessed via H2 console during runtime

### 4. **Spring Boot DevTools**
- Enables auto-reloading on code changes
- Speeds up the development process

### 5. **Spring Data JPA**
- Simplifies database interactions
- Works with Hibernate internally to map Java objects to database tables
- Provides built-in repository methods like `save()`, `findAll()`, `deleteById()`

## üìö Learning Journey
After successfully completing my **Full Stack MERN Development** journey (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), I decided to step into **Spring Boot** to expand my backend development skills in the Java ecosystem.  
This project helped me learn:
- Setting up Spring Boot projects from [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/)
- REST API development with Spring Web
- ORM with Spring Data JPA
- Using Lombok for reducing boilerplate code
- Managing in-memory databases with H2
- Hot reloading with Spring DevTools
